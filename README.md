## Packages to compute forest diversity index in IMaestro project


### Population (=stand) level metrics :
Size-Distribution related : 
        Nb of size class
        Hill Numbers (Shannon, Simpson) based on Size Class
        Skewness
        Gini index (species only)
        Skewness of size distribution
        Gini of size distribution

Species-related :
        Nb of species
        Hill Numbers (Shannon, Simpson) based on species


Metrics are calculated for each year, each site and each data source

### Plot level metrics: spatial metrics can be computed if each tree location are known
Size-Distribution related : 
        Size segregation index
        Uniform angle index 
        Structural Complexity index

Species-related :
        Species mingling index

### Landscape level metrics:
