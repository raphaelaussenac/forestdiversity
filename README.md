## Packages to compute forest diversity index in IMaestro project


### Population level metrics :
        Nb of species; Nb of size class
        Hill Numbers (Shannon, Simpson)
        Gini index (species only)
        Skewness of size

Each metric can be computed using species or size (DBH)


### Plot level metrics: spatial metrics are added to the former ones:
        Size segregation index
        Uniform angle index 
        Species mingling index
        Structural Complexity index

### Landscape level metrics:
