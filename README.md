## Packages to compute forest diversity index in IMaestro project

Outputs of model/data must be matrix with a line for each year/species/DBH.
Variables recorded must at least year, species, DBH and a weight.

Hereafter, Size = DBH


### Population (=stand) level metrics :
Size-Distribution related : 

        Nb of size class
        Hill Numbers (Shannon, Simpson) based on Size Class
        Gini index (species only)
        Skewness of size distribution
        Gini of size distribution

Species-related :

        Nb of species
        Hill Numbers (Shannon, Simpson) based on species


Metrics are calculated for each year, each site and each data source

### Plot level metrics: spatial metrics can be computed if each tree location are known
Size-Distribution related : 

        Size segregation index
        Uniform angle index 
        Structural Complexity index

Species-related :

        Species mingling index

### Landscape level metrics:
